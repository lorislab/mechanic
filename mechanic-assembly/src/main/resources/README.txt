This directory allows you run Mechanic in a normal production setting to manage your wildfly server.

ROOT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
----------------------------------------

The root of this directory is designed to run Mechanic. There are shell and batch scripts (mechanic and mechanic.bat)
which will run the Mechanic command line application.

The "lib" directory is automatically scanned by the mechanic scripts and all .jar files are added to the classpath.
